# Open-Closed Principle
It's now time for the O in SOLID, known as the open-closed principle. Simply put, classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.

Of course, the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.
